Nice to meet you! Iâ€™m Moklia, a nature enthusiast who works with plants in a research environment.

I came to Saskatoon at the beginning of 2012 without knowing anything about plants. Then I attended university, majoring in horticulture science. I had my first gardening practice in 2015, followed by balcony gardening when I lived in a condo with a south-facing deck. To expand my secrete little garden, I signed up for a plot in a nearby community garden in 2020, and have been acting as a seasonal gardener since then.
