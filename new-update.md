## Something new for this year =


### I determined to be less ambitious on crop species.
So far, I've ordered some packages of seed from Etsy, which are Scallions, Shanghai Bok Choy (Chinese veggies!!), Midori Giant Japanese Edamame Soy Bean, and Noble Giant Spinach.

I have a lot about what to grow for this year in my mind recent. Like I was so determined to try green/yellow/purple beans a month ago, but now I'm looking for more space for edamame... seems like beans need a very spacious row to grow... maybe buy fresh local beans from Soybeys could be a good alternative choice?

Another thing I cannot give up is ornamental flowers. These are good for both bees and my mental health:)
Now I'm planning to do both Zinnias (~35 cm)and dwarf carnation(~25cm), learning from the lesson last year, 1-meter tall cosmos took forever to bloom, which wasn't ideal for a cool region like Saskatoon (or I was just unlucky? but really don't want to risk again).
