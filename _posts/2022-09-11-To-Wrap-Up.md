September is normally when I wrap up my updating progress on here -- but not necessary in my plot. You know, I am greedy :) 
But this year, I will be less greedy than I normally am, because I will move to a new condo, so I need to wrap things up in the field before I move.

### Those are the produces I gained from this morning

This morning, I cleaned up a bit for those dry out plants, including a black krim tomato, a handful of beans, and two potato plants. I think I am having at least three black kirm plants this year, and they keep giving. I have save seeds from this hairloom cultivar, so hopefully, next spring, I can start my own black krim from seeds in my sunny new apartment ðŸ¤©

I am trying some purple potato this year, it turns out, I don't really love it as I thought I would be, and here are the reasons:
*  they take longer than the others to fully mature, which means they require more effort than the other cultivars
*  they tend to grow very tall that means a trade off with the other crop 
*  they are a bit spooky to eat -- as a rational human being, I know these are harvested from my own growth, so they are absolutely good to eat; however, my homo sapiens' instinct keep telling me that purple (or the Anthocyanin color) = to
xic.

I guess all the above reasons together are why purple potatoes are ruled out from the regular market.
