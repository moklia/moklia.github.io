I know it has been a while since my last update... Let me try not to abandon this site from now on. 

June has been a fruitful month for me, gardening wise, although mother nature is not as generous as she always is --- we technically had our last frost (0.9C in Sasakatoon for about 2 hours) on June 21st. Luckly nothing in my plot was touched. 

## Strawberry

Have I ever mentioned I own a strawberry patch? It all started from two rows of individual strawberry plants (crowns?). They took the whole summer last year to establish without setting any fruit. 

Finally, hard work pays off, I harvested my first strawberry on June 10th, 2021; since then, I get a handful (5, 6) of them each day and I am continue harvesting. For sure they have excellent taste, especially I always patiently wait until they are full ripen. There are two main differences between the berry I grow and the berry I pick up from a grocery store:
1. Mine are fairely small. That is beacuse of the hard weather on the prairie, we have small everything (apples, pears, cherries etc)
2. Mine tastes way softer and without a inner hollow. Softer tastes may because they are fully ripen; some of them even get a bit mushy after 4 mins walk from garden to my home. Without inner hollow... maybe because they are small? 

I did invested for a bird netting, and seems like none of my fruit get lost so far! (I definitely see a crow ramble near my straberry!) Sorry you will not get your chance Mr/Miss crow. (Do I really feel sorry? The answer is "no, I don't". ðŸ˜¬

Regarding the cultivar of my stawberry, I am not sure to be honest. I get them free from a friend, will check with her next time we meet. But I assume they are June berry as they bear berries in June. 

## Spinach

I enjoy eating spinach, and have been very lucky with growing spinach since my first attempt (throw back to year 2018). I often eat cooked spinach, this way may sound weird to you.
