I know it has been a while since my last update... no update doesn't quite mean I no gardening. 

June has been a fruitful month for me, gardening-wise. Although mother nature is not as generous as she always is --- we technically had our last frost (0.9C in Saskatoon for about 2 hours) on June 21st. Luckily, nothing in my plot was touched. 

## Strawberry

Have I ever mentioned I own a strawberry patch? It all started from two rows of individual strawberry plants (crowns?). They took the whole summer last year to establish without setting any fruit. 

Finally, my whole year hard work pays off: Ta-da!! I harvested my first strawberry on June 10th, 2021 ðŸ¥° since then, I get a handful (5, 6) of them each day and I continue harvesting. For sure they have excellent taste, especially I always patiently wait until they are full ripen. There are two main differences between the berry I grow and the berry I get from a grocery store:

1. Mine are fairly small. That is because of the hard weather on the prairie, we have smaller everything (apples, pears, cherries, etc)
2. Mine tastes way softer and without an inner hollow. Softer tastes may because they are fully ripen; some of them even get a bit mushy after 4 mins travel from my  garden to my home. Regarding the no inner hollow... maybe just because the fruits are quite small? 

I did invest for a bird netting, and seems like none of my fruit get lost so far! (I definitely see a crow ramble near my strewberry!) Sorry, you have no chance Mr/Miss crow. (Do I really feel sorry? The answer is "no, I don't". ðŸ˜¬)

Speaking of the cultivar of my strawberry, to be honest with you, my answer is "not sure". Like many of the other crops I've mentioned, I got them for free from my gardening pal, will check with her next time we meet. But I assume they are June berry as they bear berries in June. 

## Spinach

I enjoy eating spinach, and have been very lucky with growing spinach since years ago (throw back to year 2018). I often eat cooked spinach, this may sound weird to you. 

If you still remember, I ordered Norbal Giant spinach seeds online and hoped they were the variety that I consumed back home. But it turned out I see no differences between this Norbal Giant and the [Sardinia Hybird](https://www.earlysgarden.com/spinach/sardinia-hybrid) I found in Early's. I harvested them all before bolting. 

## Lettuce and Baby bok choy

Lettuce was not on my planting list until I received a bonus package of seeds from my order. On top of that, I received another free package of lettuce seed from a local library branch's seed exchange program on May 21. The seeds were packed in year 2019, with an astonishing high germination rate still.
