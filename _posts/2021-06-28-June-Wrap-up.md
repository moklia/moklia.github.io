I know it has been a while since my last update... but this does not mean I stopped gardening. 

June has been a fruitful month for me, gardening-wise, although mother nature is not as generous as she always is --- we technically had our last frost (0.9C in Saskatoon for about 2 hours) on June 21st. Luckily nothing in my plot was touched. 

## Strawberry

Have I ever mentioned I own a strawberry patch? It all started from two rows of individual strawberry plants (crowns?). They took the whole summer last year to establish without setting any fruit. 

Finally, hard work pays off, I harvested my first strawberry on June 10th, 2021; since then, I get a handful (5, 6) of them each day and I continue harvesting. For sure they have excellent taste, especially I always patiently wait until they are full ripen. There are two main differences between the berry I grow and the berry I pick up from a grocery store:
1. Mine are fairly small. That is because of the hard weather on the prairie, we have small everything (apples, pears, cherries, etc)
2. Mine tastes way softer and without an inner hollow. Softer tastes may because they fully ripen; some of them even get a bit mushy after 4 mins walk from garden to my home. Without inner hollow... maybe because they are small? 

I did invest for a bird netting, and seems like none of my fruit get lost so far! (I definitely see a crow ramble near my strewberry!) Sorry, you have no chance Mr/Miss crow. (Do I really feel sorry? The answer is "no, I don't". ðŸ˜¬

Regarding the cultivar of my strawberry, I am not sure, to be honest. I get them free from a friend, will check with her next time we meet. But I assume they are June berry as they bear berries in June. 

## Spinach

I enjoy eating spinach, and have been very lucky with growing spinach since my first attempt (throw back to year 2018). I often eat cooked spinach, this way may sound weird to you. 

If you still remember, I ordered Norbal Giant spinach seeds online and hoped they were the variety that I consumed back home. But it turned out I see no differences between this Norbal Giant and the [Sardinia Hybird](https://www.earlysgarden.com/spinach/sardinia-hybrid) I found in the local store. I harvested them all before bolting. 

## Lettuce and Baby bok choy

Lettuce was not on my planting list until I received a bonus package of seed from my order. On top of that, I received another free package of lettuce seed from a local library's seed exchange program on May 21. The seed exchange seeds were packed in year 2019, with an astonishing high germination rate.
