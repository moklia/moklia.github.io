I am almost on the last day of the first week of August. Today is very windy, and the night temperature will drop to 5C as the lowest according to weather forecast.


### Homesteader pea 
I had my 1st round of homesteader pea wrapped up last week, the second round is coming along the way. It feels amazing to go to your own garden before supper, to harvest, and shelling the freshest ever pea in the garden, then damp the shell into compost, and bring them home for supper. That's my 0 carbon footprint (I walked to my garden), 0 waste (all the no-editable residues went to compost bin) practice, which brought me 100% happiness.

### Snow pea

I don't have a picture for them, unfortunately. Also, I harvested them a bit too late than ideal. I harvested at the stage that they already have very plump seeds, the shells were less crunchy/juicy/sweet. But still very editable when cooked.

### Sunflower

I practiced direct seeding for my editable sunflower this year, so they are slower than the previous two years. But it turned out well, and very pollinator attracting. I don't really enjoy this cultivar's seeds that much to be honest, I guess because they are too small, but I enjoy it as a flower. A very summer flower.

### Yellow bean

Again, I harvest lots of my yellow bean a bit later than ideal (which was last night, August 4, not the ones in this image). I didn't grow beans for so many years was because I was worried about they only allow one big harvest at a time. But turns out this isn't the case. They ripen gradually over the last two weeks, and there are more coming along the way as well. Yellow bean was the bush type I picked didn't even require too much space. Personally, I think bush beans are even better than peas as they first don't take too much space; second, they don't require any trells to support their tall grow habit; thirdly, they are very effective, as the ratio between ____


### Cucumber

My cucumber isn't doing well this year for so many reasons. First, we are not having a lot of heat in general this year. Second, they are shaded by over grow purple potato (not sure what's going on with this potato cultivar, it's almost three months by now since I planted them, they are still very immaure!), my neighbour's corn + tall sunflower. We finally put some poles for them to climb last time, hopefully, this would help. Will have another update in a week or two.
