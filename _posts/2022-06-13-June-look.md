I am back from a one week long road trip, and observed there were not too much change in my plot (great!)

But still, things are all coming out, and I finally have cucumber planted today.

### Strawberry

Strawberries are taking longer to ripen this year, I had my first fruit ready last year on June 9th. But seems like they are producing more fruits than last year also.
