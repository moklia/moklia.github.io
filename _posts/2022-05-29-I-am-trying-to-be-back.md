Now it's May of the year again, I finally realize why last year's May was a complete white off (no post for the entire month). It was because I was busy planting. I am busy planting this month again, there is so much happening right now, and so much to do. It's just so hard to balance doing work with finding time to sit down and share the work. But by writing this post now, I am proud to say "I made it!". 

This year is even busier for me on top of everthing else, as the Horticulture club I am involving (it's a student union I have been part of since my undergarates and I am still with them now) is resuming and we are planting at both the horticulture field and the roof top graden on campus. Thanks to the restrction lifting!

Ok, let's focus on talking about my plot:

I am being a bit less gung ho this year in terms of what to plant and how to plant in my plot. But still, by yesterday, I have everthing other than cucumber planted. I really love how everything come out. 

Those are what I have for the year:
* Camomile, well, they appear like weed from seeds last fall, and I am asked to clean them out
* Cilantro (volunteers again)
* Garlic chives
* Green onions
* Dwarf carnation, three of them had successfully overed winter, hopefully they can bloom this year 
* Zinnia
* Strawberry 
* Black krim tomato x4
* Juliet tomato x3 
* Tumbler tomato x2
* Jalapeno pepper x3
* Cosmos (from transplant, already in bloom)
* Edemame bean
* Bean
* Spinach
* Lettuce 
* Snow pea and __pea 

Ah, I am more ambitious than I thought I am.  

###Strawberry 

After two year, my strawberry are slowly occupying way more space than they suppose to take. I have at least dug 35 plants out earlier in the season. I guess they are June bearing berry, as they stop producing by July 1st sharp last year.
They are producing a lot more blooms than last year due to the fact that they are expanding, so I am hoping more flowers = more üçì

### Zebra green tomato

I got these babie tomato seedlings from what left after we planted the roof top garden. It's a new cultivar to me, and I am always happy to try out new crops (grow +taste). The photo on right is how the fruits would look, the photo is downloaded from here [Zebre tomato](https://www.growjoy.com/store/pc/Green-Zebra-Tomato-Plant-p9078.htm)

According to the production description, zebra green has tart flavor, good for salad or sandwitch. It's look and flavor really reminds me of the tomatillos. I guess it might not be the best fit for my diet, but well worth to try out.
