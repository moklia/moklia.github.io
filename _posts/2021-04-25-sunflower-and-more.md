## Sunflower
Once again, I started 6 edible sunflower seeds indoors. This was done after my seed inventory this morning. Prairie gardeners, admit it, we always have to compromise on the climate with smaller fruits. (Sour cherry, crabapple, etc...) Also, edible sunflowers. Or I should simply say that I am not a big fan of the prairie sunflower seeds---tastewise. Even so, I really like the fact that sunflowers seeds are extraditionary food source for our hardworking pollinators. I've been observing chubby bumblebees carrying yellow pollen on their tiny legs many times buzzing on my sunflowers during the last growing season. 


## Jonny jump-up 
They didn't make it to the blooming stage last year on my north-facing balcony. They germinated, hung in there for a while, then I moved them into my plot within the community garden. It turned out too much direct sunlight also wasn't a good idea, as they all pass out.. then I had to pick up some mature plants from a commercial greenhouse. They all thrive on my balcony then. 


## Lettuce 
Lettuce isn't my favourite, but I received free lettuce seedlings from my gardening pal last year. 

This year again, I got lettuce seeds as a freebie. Therefore, lettuce again will make its way to my plot.
