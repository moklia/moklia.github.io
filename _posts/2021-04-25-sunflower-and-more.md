I've planted 6 edible sunflower seeds indoor after my seed inventory this morning. Prairie gardeners, you know, have to compromise the climate with smaller fruit for many crops, including sunflower seeds. Or I should simply say that I am not a big fan of the prairie sunflower---tastewise. But I like the fact that sunflowers are extraditionary food source for our hardworking pollinators. I've been observing chubby bumblebees carrying yellow pollen on their tiny legs many times buzzing on my sunflowers during the last growing season. 


Jonny jump-up 
didn't make it last year on my north-facing balcony. Too much direct sunlight also .. then I had to buy mature plant from a commerical greenhouse 


Lettuce 
Lettuce aren't included in my diet, but I received free lettcue seedlings from my friend last year. 

I was too greedy ... bitter with the summer ramp up... not edible anymore
