I was on vacation during the Canada Day long weekend and noticed everything were grown like crazy during my away. 

I find it is always a debate bwtween cool season crops VS warm season crops. 
On the one hand, when the temperature hits +35C (it happens on the prairie this year!!) snow pea suffers. I observed the bottom couple of nodes and leaves turned yellow, and newly grow leaves curling. (hopuflly these are just symptoms from physical stress instead of any disease).
On the other hand, cucmber (already developed two female flowers on one plant!) and tomato thrive.

**Baby boy choy made its way to my dinner table after bites from flee bettle**

Speaking of flee bettles, I find a way to git rid of them. These damn pest tend to become immobile when they get wet. So I bacially hand pick and kill them after my plot has a good drink.
