I was on vacation during the Canada Day long weekend and noticed everything was grown like crazy when I was gone. 

I find it is always a trade off between cool season crops and warm season crops. 
On the one hand, when the temperature hits +35C (believe it or not, it happens on the prairie this year!!) snow pea suffers. For snow pea, I observed the bottom couple of nodes and leaves turned yellow while having the new leaves become curling. (hopeflly, these are just symptoms from physical stress instead of any type of disease).
On the other hand, cucumber (already developed two female flowers on one of my plants!) and tomato thrive.

**Baby bok choy made its way to my dinner table after from flee bettle bites** ðŸ˜Œ

Speaking of flee bettles, I find a way to git rid of them: these damn pests tend to become immobile when they get wet. So I bascially handpick and kill them after my plot has a good drink.
