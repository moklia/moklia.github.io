I haven't talked too much about my tomatoes, because they are too common. I bet every gardner had dealt with them at some level. But tomatoes are truely one of a kind and under appreciated by me.

I had a fancy hanging string design in my garden last year, which is a thing people still talking about this year. But I also had too much tomatoes planted... well, I know you may say "you can never have too many tomatos"... but truth on the prairie here is, you won't harvest tomato grdually over the season. You are most likely to get them ALL from late July to the frost.
