We are at the peak of the prairie's summer. It has been like +30 degree as daily highest for about a week so far. Although it is hard for me as a human without air conditionerï¼Œmy crops are surly benefit A LOT. There are very noticable changes on my tomato and cucumbers every other day over the last week. 

### Yellow Bean

Why noone before told me that grow bean can be this rewarding?? Yellow bean are so easy to take care of- they don't get as tall as any peas, they don't need trellis to climb, and they are so productive. 

I have done some research earlier this year since this is going to be my first time. Seems like there are two types of beans. For the bush type, they is no need to install climbing trellis. Foe the yellow bean I am having this year in particualar, they only get about 50cm tall as mature plants.
Also is also another bean type called pole (which I am also experimenting this year), they need trellis.

If you followed my previous post you would have heard my story with this those not very comman tomatos. It's finally the time to enjoy them. I watched a youtube video that reviewd on Barry's crazy, which said the chickpea like tip on the tomatos can be sharp to swallow, but I personally don't have this problem. Taste wise, they are slightly sweet, but not that much flavorful. 

### Peas

**Snow pea**
I have planted both homesteader pea and snow pea this year. But I kind of having them mixed together and go a bit confused which is which. Today I finally figure out that mature snow peas have wider and flater pods than the homesteader peas.
