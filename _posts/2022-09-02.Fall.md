Until this year, I finally start to realized, for the prairie, tomatoes are fall crops instead of the sumemer crop. They often not ready until the late August and early September. I was trying to have different cultivars to spread the ripen time, but still, even for the "suppose to be the earliest cherry tomatos", they are on their best late in the season. So here is a basket of the Barry's crazy cherry tomatom.
