As I mentioned earlier, I am attempting to grow my own fresh cut flower again this year. I picked three packs of seeds yesterday from Early's, which are 
* Camomile
* Dwarf carnation
* Zinnia 


There are lots of things in this world that make me happy, to name one, flowers! However, I only buy flowers once in a while to treat myself due to their high price. So why not have those beauty growing on my own plot? Then I can harvest them anythime, FOR FREE! This is where the idea comes from. 

I know there are some community gardens in the city that only allow food produces, I'm glad mine has more flexibility. Flowers, I believe are excellent food sources for pollinators, which means my practice can be a win-win. 

Last year, I planted cosmos.  I observed that cosmos lasts fairly long as fresh cut flower from a u-pick flower experience, therefore, I was hoping to give these long-lasting beauty a try. Sadly, I fail. For some reason, my cosmos decided they don't want to bloom (not enough heat maybe?). The plants were perfectly healthy, but just did not produce flower buds in a timely manner. By the time they finally ready to bloom at the end of August, it was too late. The most heart-breaking moment I've ever experienced as a gardener was to witness their death--- they were killed by early frost. It was on September 7th, I still remember. SIGH. You know prairie... we have very short frost free period. 

One day, I may pull myself together to give cosmos another try, but definitely not this year. I need a more guaranteed nominee.

## Back to this year's candidates:

* Camomile
I've been growing camomile as a herb in the past two years and used them as tea. But somehow I don't really enjoy the taste of it, which almost stop me from putting into my plot again this year. One day, I was inspired by a random picture of a flower bouquet, in that picture, the folrist had put the camomile into a vase. This picture surely triggered a ta-da moment in my brain. What a genius idea!! Camomile in my opinion is so cheap (a seed pack comes with more than 100 seeds and only costs $1.99 CAD),easy to grow and care for. Even the growing instruction suggests to satrt indoor 6-8 weeks before the last frost, but they thrived last year after direct seeded practice. 

* Dwarf carnation
Carnation is another type of fresh cut flower I find has long vase life. I've never image myself growing carnation before I find this dwarf species. It also recommends start seeds indoor 6-8 weeks ahead of time. 


* Zinnia
