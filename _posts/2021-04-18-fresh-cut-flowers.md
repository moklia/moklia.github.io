Attempting to grow my own fresh cut flower again this year. I've picked three packs of seeds yesterday from Early's, which are 
* Camomile
* Dwarf carnation
* Zinnia 


Cutting flower has always been my thing; however, I only buy them once in a while to treat myself due to their high price. So how about having those flowering species gowing on my own plot? This is where the original idea comes from. 

I know there are some community gardens only allow gardeners to grow food produce, I'm glad mine has more flexibility. Flowers, I believe are excellent food sources for pollinator, which means my practice will be a win-win. 

Last year, I tried cosmos.  I just happened to notice cosmos lasts fairely long as fresh cut flower from previous experience. Sadly, last year I fail. For some reason, my cosmos decided they don't want to bloom. They were healthy, but just did not produce flower buds in a timely manner. When they were finally ready to bloom at the end of August, it was too late. The most heart breaking momennt I've ever experienced as a gardener was to witness their death--- they were killed by frost on September 7th. You know prairie... we have very short frost free period. 

One day, I may pull myself together to give cosmos another try, but definitely not this year.
