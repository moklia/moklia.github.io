I was about to name this article as "it's officially fall". But Google told me that September 22 will be the first day of fall, officially. So I changed my title. 

Mother nature is being so generous to me this year. There was no hail or severe wind damage or anything like that in my area throughout the growing season, although I was alerted so many times by the weather forecast. 

Now I'm at a point to gradually admit, it's ok to wrap up my garden. But I still hope the no frost period can last as long as it can be, maybe even beyond October. For the predictable next week, seems like we still have very promising good weather ðŸ™‚ I recall last year our frost day was on the 6th.
