I was about to say "it's officially fall". After some carefully confirming, google told me September 22 is the first day of fall, officially. So I changed my title. 

Mother nature is being generous to me this year. There was no hail at all or severe wind damage or so in the area I'm living throughout the growing season even after I was alerted so many times by the weather forecast. 

Now I'm at a point, gradually admit, it's ok to wrap up my garden. But I still hope the no frost period can last as long as it can. Even beyond October. For the predictable next week, seems like we still have very promising good weather ðŸ™‚ I recall last year our frost day was on the 6th.
