The prairie is slowly entering into the peak of summer, each day, I get to enjoy some harvest from my little garden. 

## English pea wrap up & Snow pea begins 

I have harvested over 5lbs of pea (before shelling) since July 10th. I feel confident to give other gardeners advice: if you are looking for a massive harvest, try to sow narrowly. 
I practiced narrow sow for two reasons:

1.  My seeds were from two years ago so I worried about germination rate
2.  Originally I planned to harvest pea shoot as veggie 

But turned out all of my peas make it and I used all of them from pods. It was a successful experiment, you don't have to always follow growing instruction. 

Since the weather is optimum, and it's only July 20ish, I play greedy this year--- I buried more snow pea seed into soil last night (Jul 25th) and see how they turned out. This type of pea has ediable seed pod, so hopefully I can have something before the frost. 

To reward my generous garden, I added over 60L of compost to my plot. These compost are picked up free from [City of Saskatoon](https://www.google.ca/maps/place/City+of+Saskatoon+West+Compost+Depot/@52.1161968,-106.7759053,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x5304f9cee6bc700f:0x97cc4a2b2cd369ce!8m2!3d52.1161968!4d-106.7737166_)


## Spinach round 2 

And more spinach seeds were put into soil again yesterday. I used [New Zealand perennial](https://www.earlysgarden.com/spinach-perennial/new-zealand-perennial-1770-heirloom-variety) because its package says this variety is >heat tolerance and resistance to bolting to seed. (That sounds perfect for late summer but I won't expect it can survive our winter)


## Edamame bloomed

My most exciting moment during this growing season so far happened on last Thursday (Jul 22) --- my edamame bloomed. Edamame is my creative trying this year because my husband loves them as a kid. "Nothing beats fresh edamade" he told me.
But there is not much trying of edamame in Saskatoon as far as I know. Bascially because our typical growing season here is not hot and long enough. I ordered seeds online, but they didn't come out. Therefore I went to an Asian store and picked up a package of organic soybean and used them as seed.
I was very nervous about my creative project because there was no symbol of bloom in the last couple of weeks. 

Edamame has very delicate flowers, they are tiny on the nodes, with the similar look as pea flowers (so why soybean is called bean not pea ðŸ¤”), purple or white in color. 

## Sunflowers

My biggest sunflower (started on Apr 25) is almost ready to be harvested. I tried to capture all its bloom stages.
