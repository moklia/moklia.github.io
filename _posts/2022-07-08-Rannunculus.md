## Rannunculus
Rannunculus must be the title of today's post, because, they are finally IN BLOOM!!

Those are all the rannunculus related photos I ontained in the past two weeks, they all just made my heart so happy! The process of how I got the rannunculus started was fully domucented in my first post this year, click here to read it -> [New Season](https://moklia.github.io/2022/04/16/New-Season.html)

* The slightly lighter pink one on top is the bloom from the expensive corm.

I only brought one of them home to put in vase, for the rest, I just hope them to keep staying in the garden to enjoy the light anf rain. They are so graceful beings, they look just like the expensive fresh cut flower you find in flower shop. I had a gardener praise themï¼Œshe said "they are almost like artifical flowers".

## Strawberry

They go wild this year.

Cannot remember how much fruit I have harvested this year exactly, but here is the approximate math: I had my first berry on June 16, then, since June 22, I have at least had 7 times ~250gram harvest, that's about 4lbs of berries so far! It's now slowly wrapping up for the year, which still gives me a handful of fruits each day.
