I am out of idea of a fancy title, so here is the title you see. But literally, this post means to record the look in my plot for another week in June. 

## Strawberry

As we all expect, June is all about strawberries. After three seasons hardwork, this year, strawberry plants becomes very prolific. Since June 20, I have been able to harvest about a handful of them each day.

We are having a very wet spring this year, there was almost no active watering thougout last two weeks. Also as you can see in the picture, strawberries and spinach are all covered with muddy water splash, thanks to the rain. 

## Perpetual Spinach

I don't have an individual picture to show spinach. This perpetual spinach kind of suffering from pest invasion on leaves. This cultivar suppose to last full summer long but I am so worried about they bolt in mid summer. This spinach taste somehow salty without adding any seasoning. 

I reused the spinach row to plant more bush yellow bean this morning, as I learned bush type bean doesn't require any supporting trellis. Let's see how it goes.

## Soybean 

Because the edamame bean I planted last year was a great success, I hoped to duplicate it again. But I was to cheap to buy new seeds, or I just don't have enough space/ethusium so I reused to leafover seeds from last year. The germination rate is quite low, so far, this is the only one comes out. But I guess this isn't a good year for soybean anyway (not enough heat).

## Ranunculus

It has been a lot of work since March to start the rannuculus from corms. The corms I picked from dollar tree were doing way better than the more expensive cultivar I bought from Early's because of various reasons. They were transplanted on the 2nd or 3rd week in May and finally decide to bring some flower buds. I guess this would almost be their last chance to bloom as they don't appreciate mid summer heat.

**Not sure if this is going to be the bloom from the only one left corm from the expensive one**

**Seems to be a yellow flower** 


## Bonus one

After a year long break from cosmos, they made their way to my plot again! Although I harvested some cosmos seeds from others' plot late last fall, I bought some transplants from superstore this year. Look, they are already in bloom! No need to desperately wait until August, $5 spent, eveyone is happy!
