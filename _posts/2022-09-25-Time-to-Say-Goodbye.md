It sounds like a big progress that I am still in the mood of updating when it's September 25th. 

There isn't yet any devastating froest in my area so I still let tomatos grow happily in the field. But I feel more comfortable to let things go this year compared to the previous two years, which is also a big progress. That means I am also enjoy the other aspects of my life after all these covid monthes.

Also I have to admit, we are getting lucky again this year in terms of the timing of the frost. So far, we have had about 3 nights that my phone received frost alert. Luckily, the lowest tempterature for all these three nights only dropped to 0 degree for about an hour at 6am, so none of it caused any noticable damage in my plot. I am also feeling proud for not overreact to get things covered as in the previous years lol. 

Without further ado, these are what I got from the garden this morning

### Green zebra tomato

I finally have a vine ripen green zebra to show off.
