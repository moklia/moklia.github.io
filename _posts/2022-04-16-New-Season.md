I am back, as well as the spring on the prairie. Although we had been through several snowy days last week.


## Pioneers
I was in my plot yesterday and happy to ssee both my onion multiplier and strawberry are pushing out new leaves. I may expect to harvest a bit of the onion leaves the end of next week --- before anything else even started. We shall see whether these onion really get to multiply themselevs.

## Ranunculus
I'd like to try new crops each year, especially flowers. So here are my experience with rannunculus: 

I bought two types of ranuculus corms (seed), one from a dollar tree store, costs only $1.25 for 4 corms. I experimented with the dollar tree corms on March 26 with great success, the germinate rate was 11/12. The fastest corm had roots came out within less than 72 hours.

The other came from a professional garden center with the cultivar from Holland. It costs $8.99 for 10 corms. Unfortunately, my good luck wasn't transferable to this more expensive cultivar. The outside temperature hit 10+ on that weekend (Apr 3rd), with even higher room temperature I bet. Therefore, lots of the corms got molded. I was only able to save 1/10 of them.

## Baby bok choy 

I am hoping to start baby bok choy early this year then transplant to my plot when the weather allows. I recall last year I started the seeds out on May 5th. But by that time there was no irrigation system in the communtiy garden yet, so they die.
