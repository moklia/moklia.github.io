Until this year, I finally start to realize, for the prairie, tomatoe is definitely fall crop instead of the sumemer crop. They often not ready until the late August or early September. Although I was trying to select from different cultivars to fill my garden, in order to spread over the ripen time; still, even for the "suppose to be the earliest, cherry tomatos", they are on their best late in the season as the others. This is a basket of the Barry's crazy cherry I harvested from this morning.

White zinnias are my favourite this year as they blend in well with all the other colourful flowers. Not sure if all these individual flowers in the picture are orginally from the exact same stem or not. It feels like, when you give a plant enough space, it will try to surprise you with its gigantic size.

I am heading to a trip tomorrow (finally!), me and my trip have been patiently wait until Sepetmber, as I learnt from last year's experience that I better not leave the garden alone during the peak of the season. But here we are having a late year on prairie, according to another gardener, everything is 2 weeks behind. Luckliy, we seem not to have an early frost either.
