Until this year, I finally start to realized, for the prairie, tomatoes are fall crops instead of the sumemer crop. They often not ready until the late August or early September. I was trying to pick from different cultivars, in order to spread the ripen time, but still, even for the "suppose to be the earliest, cherry tomatos", they are on their best late in the season. This is a basket of the Barry's crazy cherry I harvested from this morning.

White zinnias are my favourite this year.

I am heading to a trip tomorrow, I have been patiently wait until Sepetmber, as I learnt from last year's experience that I better not leave the garden during the peak of the season. But we are having a late year this year, according to another gardener, everything is 2 week behind. Luckliy, we seem not have an early frost either.
