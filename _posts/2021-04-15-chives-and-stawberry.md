The growing season by far is nowhere near prairie, except for my perennial garlic chives.  I wasn't 100% sure whether they are really my over winter chives or they are just random weed (this has always been a gardener's concern) at the beginning. However, it has been confirmed by my tastebuds today:)

Oh, I forget to say, garlic chives have flat blade leaves, which is different from what you normally find on prairie. I assume the cylindrical hollow leaves chives are easier to be identified from weeds compared to the flat blade ones. 

Growing up in China, my family uses garlic chives as a vegetable, either stir fried with egg or use them as a stuffing for dumplings. 
I never recall seeing hollow leaves chives back home, so I was amazed by the chive species we have here on the prairie. They look way more like fine green onions than chives to me :)
I find people here using chives as spices instead of veggies, it helps to add more flavor to salads or soups. 

Also, I got to learn that both onions and chives are in the Allium genus; while garlic, shallot, leeks are the other popular species under this genus. All these members tend to have a strong scent, which potentially help to repel annoying pests in the garden
?
I won't say I love chives or any other things from the Allium in general, they are too strong to my taste buds. Well, it's good to use a little bit of them as a spice to add flavor. But my husband loves garlic chives, therefore, I'm growing them for him.
