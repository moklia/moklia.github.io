I started to see the chive seedlings two days ago. By that time I wasn't 100% sure whether they are really my over winter chives or they are just random weed??(this has always been my concern as a gardener).
This has been confirmed by a taste today:)

Oh, forget to say, I am growing flat blade chives. I assume the cylindrical hollow leaves chives are easier to be identified from weeds compared to the flat blade ones. 

Growing up in China, my family uses flat chives as a vegetable, either stir fried with egg or use them as he stuffing for dumplings. 
I never recall seeing hollow leaves chives back home, so I was amazed by the chive species we have here on the prairie. They look more like fine green onions than chives in my opinion :)
I find people here on the prairie often use chives as spices than veggies, to add more flavor to their salad, or dress up the soup. 

Then I got to learn that both onions and chives are in the Allium genus; while garlic, shallot, leeks are the other popular species uner this genus. All these members tend to have a strong scent, which potentionally help to repel annoying bugs?
I won't say I love chives or any other things from the Allium in general, they are too strong to my taste buds. But my husband loves chives, therefore, I grow them for him.
