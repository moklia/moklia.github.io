I started to see the chive seedlings since two days ago. By that time I wasn't 100% sure wether they are really my over winter chives or they are just random weed??(this has always been my concern as a gardener).
This has been confirmed by a taste today:)

Oh, forget to say, I am growing flat blade chives. I assume the cylindrical hollow leaves chievs are easier to be identified from weeds compared to the flat blade ones. 

Growing up in China, my family uses flat chieves as vegetable, either stir fried with egg or use them as he stuffing for dumplings. 
I never recall of seeing hollow leaves chives back home, so I was amazed by the chive species we have here on the prairie. They look more like fine green onions than chives in my opinion :)
I find people here on the prairie often use chives as spices than veggies, to add more flavor to their salad, or dress up the soup. 

Then I got to learn that both onions and chives are in the Allium genus; while garlic, shallot, leeks are the other popular species uner this genus. All these member tend to have strong scent.
I won't say I love chives or any other things from the Allium in general, they are too strong to my taste buds. But my husband loves chives, therefore, I grow them for him.
