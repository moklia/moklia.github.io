Must say I've been very lucky lately with my pea growing. Because of the known unusual heat this year on the prairie, I could tell cool season leugme crop suffered. Thankfully, I decided not to grow green/yellow/purple beans before the season begins, I observed flowers die out before bloom in other gardeners' plots (feel so sorry for them, hopefully they will bounce back soon).

Other than the bean, some of my gardening neighbours' pea also suffered--- symptoms like yellow out or non-plump pod were all observed. Despite all that, mine are doing good in general. My trick is to give them a generous drink each day; however, there is one symptom showed on my peas as well: rust appears around the edge of every single of my leaves. I've consulted my friend (he is on the way grow into a plant pathologist) about the suspicious symptom. My friend diagnosed it as physical stress instead of a disease. 
He believes, for a disease, there must be an intrude spot on the leaf; therfore, rust evenly distributes along the edge is more likely to be a phenomenon of physically stress. Other than the leaves, my pea pods is 100% healthy.

I had about 150gram harvest (before shelling)at the beginning of the week, followed by 717gram harvest. So basically, only 1/2 of the fruit out of the total harvest is edible. I am looking forward to another massive harvest next week.
