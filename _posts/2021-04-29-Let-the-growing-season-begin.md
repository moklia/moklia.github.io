We are having a dry spring on the prairie this year, even without receiving enough rainfall, I finally decide to let the growing season begin in my tiny plot. Hopefully my seeds can survive our night temperture. Today is April 29. 

Pioneers here I have including the following: 
* Garlic chives
* Buttercrunch lettuce
* Bok choy
* Scallion 

I have all the seeds soaked overnight before I planted them. According to some instructions, soaking overnight can better weak up the seeds for earlier germination. (recommend over 24 hrs while below 48 hrs soaking)

These are what I find out on May 5th! Takes less than a week for these bok choy baby to come out! And seems like they weren't killed by an unexpected rototiller!

I may have some garlic chives come out, but it's a bit harder to tell since I've been having some coming out since a couple of weeks ago. 
Regarding the rest *Buttercrunch lettuce* and *Scallion*, I don't know whether they are not ready yet or they have been kiled by the rototiller I've mentioned earlier. We shall see.
