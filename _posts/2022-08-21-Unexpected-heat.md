Normally, it starts to feel like fall on the prairie by this time of the year. It's kind of hard to describe how it "feels" like fall, could be the cold wind at the dusk or the notice of yellow leaves on top of a tree when you stare at the sky. 

But the weather is very different this year. Since last Monday, we started to have +30 as the hottest, and it will the end this week, according to the weather forcase. That's over 2 weeks' heat, which helps my warm season crop to catch up, but definitely not normal to the prairie. 

### Tomatoes 

I haven't have too much updates on my tomatoes this year so far. They are just a bit too normally for my attention, but here they are:

I have to show these two baskets. Veggies in them are mainly from my garden plot, with also some of them gifted to me by the other gardeners. So I get to try the purple beans, which I love love them. Although the purple color disappear during the cooking, I can defentely tell the difference of the purples to the greenones from the texture fIn the meantime, I also share mine with the other gardeners when I can.
