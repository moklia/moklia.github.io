Today marks the last day of the season, as it will drop to -7C in the am. 

I haven't been to the garden for about 5 days, because I was quite busy moving into a new apartment. By the time I land on the garden again, I was totally impressed by the bloom of the cosmos. It was almost the first time for me to harvest a bag full of the beauties. I divided them into three parts, and hope they would also bring my friends the same excitment from the fresh blooms.

I know the season has been long enough for a prairie gardener, but it is still extremely hard for me to say good bye. 

Despite the fact that I will be living on the new location next year, I don't same I can leave everything here behind. 

I will come back, come back to the Sutherland, back to the community garden, and back to the Moklia's Little Garden site :heart:
