My green thrumbs have been itchy for a while. Howeve, today's strom （100 km/h wind guests + feels like -20 during midnight) makes me wonder if I ever deserve a season that is called "spring" in Saskatoon at all? I've got my seeds already ordered from Etsy, no matter what. 

I know I've promised to be less aggressive regarding the crop species this year... here is a BUT. 

But I really want to give new crops a try!! So,,

### Here are what's in my mind for the coming season (with the seeds coming along the way):

* Scallions
* Noble Giant Spinash
* Shanghai Bok Choy (Chinese veggies!!)
* Edamame soy bean

### Other than abovementioned 4 crops,

I am eyeing on edamame beans...and I am attempting to trade off the limited space from  green/yellow/purple beans to edamame beans.... (green/yellow/purple beans from local farmers market might just taste as good as my home grown produce... maybe??)

In case you are not familar with edamame beans--- they are immature soybean, green in pods, which goes well in different dishes. 

Another thing I surly cannot give up is ornamental flower. These flowers are good for both bees and my mental health:) This year, I’m planning to grow both Zinnias (~35 cm in height)and dwarf carnation(~25cm). I learnt my lesson last year: 1-meter tall cosmos takes forever to bloom, which isn't ideal for a cool region like Saskatoon (or I was just had bad luck)? Anyway... I really don’t want to risk again.

### What else? 
Conventional garden crops such as tomato, potato, cucumber, will be considered. I will have a full list in the coming weeks. 

Looking forward to starting my potato indoor  :)
