My green thrumbs have been itchy for a while. Although today's strom （100 km/h wind guests + feels like -20 during midnight) makes me wonder if I deserve a season that is called "spring" in Saskatoon? Anyway, I've already ordered seeds from Etsy. 

I know I've promised to be less aggressive regarding the crop species this year... here is a BUT. 

But I really want to try new crops!! So,,

### Here is what's in my mind (with the seeds packs on their ways):

* Scallions
* Noble Giant Spinash
* Shanghai Bok Choy (Chinese veggies!!)
* Edamame soy bean

### Other than these 4,

I was so determined to try green/yellow/purple beans a month ago, but now I’m looking for more space for edamame… seems like beans need a very spacious row to grow… maybe buy fresh local beans from stores like Soybeys could be a good alternative choice?

In case you are not familar with edamame--- they are immature soybean, green in pods.

Another thing I cannot give up is ornamental flowers. These are good for both bees and my mental health:) Now I’m planning to do both Zinnias (~35 cm)and dwarf carnation(~25cm), learning from the lesson last year, 1-meter tall cosmos took forever to bloom, which wasn’t ideal for a cool region like Saskatoon (or I was just unlucky? but really don’t want to risk again).

### What else? 
Traditional garden crops such as tomato, potato, cucumber, will surely be grown again. Will have a full list in the coming weeks. 

Looking forward to start my potato sports soon :)
