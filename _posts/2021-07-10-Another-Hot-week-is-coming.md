It seems that we can expect for another hot week. We are experiencing extreme weather on the prairie this year. Cannot remember how many heat warning were issued since May. 
But personally, I appreciate these bonus hot days, hope this is an asset for my edamame beans (no flower so far, forgot to take a picture this morning).

I did more harvest for leafy veggies these days. I believe it is a good timing (or already a bit over?) to have them wrapped up before they bolt. My poor little lettuce, they are overmature by now. Sure though, they become extremely bitter again (this had happened to me last year).
Definitely not sharable with friends anymore :( 

Okay! Let's be positive now (attitude-wise not covid): I got my first vine ripen tomato last week. Isn't it look like a cute heart in the middle of my basket?? :heart: Thr mother plant was transplanted after the first fruit was set off. The little heart is racking on its skin, thanks to the physical stress (wind burn I guess).

My camomile has been living in this displaying mug for 6 days, still very vigorous with pleasant smell ---so satisfying ðŸ˜Œ On top of that, I added in more cilantro flower. These are from my volunteer cilantro  (I call them "vilantro") plants. Intend to birth control on them by picking them up at flower stage. 

Plus, one of my sunflow is blooming ðŸ¥°
