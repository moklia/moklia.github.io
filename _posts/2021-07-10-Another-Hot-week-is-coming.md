Seems like we are expecting another hot week. We are experiencing extreme weather on the prairie this year. Cannot remember how many heat warning day had happened since May. 
But personally, I appreciate these bonus hot days, hope this is an asset for my edamame beans (no flower so far, forget to take a picture this morning).

I did more harvest for leafy veggies these days. I believe it is good timing (or already a bit over?) to have them wrapped up before they bolt. My poor little lettuce, they have already become extremely bitter.
Surely not sharable with friends anymore. Let us be positive here (attitude-wise not covid): I harvest my first vine ripen tomato last week. To me, it looks like a cute heart in the middle of my basket :heart: One of my sunflow is bloom as well.

I transplanted the mother plant after the first fruit was set off. Cracking on its skin, thanks to the physical stress (wind burn very likely).

My fresh cut camomile has been living in a vase size mug for 6 days, still very vigorous with pleasant smell ---so satisfying ðŸ˜Œ On top of that, I added in more cilantro flower. These are from my volunteer vilantro plants. Intend to birth control on them by picking them up at flower stage.
