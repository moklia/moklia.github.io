I went on a long trip on Jul.29. By the morning before I left, it was the peak of the summer, everything in the garden was stunning. The garden was so hard to left behind, I stayed there until the very last minute before my trip.

**Those were the fresh harvested produce on that morning**

The feeling of the garden was completely different by the time I was in my garden again, that day was 8.9. Everything was covered by a fall look: the browning coriander, overripen fruits on bushy tomato plants, low headed sunflowers... (snow pea seedlings came out as expected, but not quite for baby bok choy and spinach) 
Although my plot was under precious care by a friend... You know what, I was so disappointed because I felt I've missed the best time of the season. 
As a gardener, I was determined to record every stage of my crops. 

Note to self: never leave for overweek trip during the growing season. 

Anyway...

There aren't many new exciting things happening in the garden lately, besides my edamame beans are slowly forming pods. They are not plump yet, and I'm not sure how to help them. Hopefully, they will change over time.

Garlic chives flower are impressive, I almost attempt to harvest a bouquet of them. I remember there is a kind of dipping sauce from my dad's side made from garlic chive flower.

Cherry tomatos are like the lights in my life, love them always.
